// Write a function that asks the user for 3 numbers, adds them all up then multiply 
// them by 3. You must check that the users input is a number if it isn't
// prompt the user again




// ============================================

// Write a function called 'finishSentence' that takes two inputs,  an array and a function

// your callback function called 'combine' should combine two strings together and return them
// finishSentence should loop through the given array prompt the user with the questions in the array
// and combine the elements in the array with the word given in the prompt and alert the answer
//*** Bonus: accomplish the same result without the finishSentence function and use an array method

const list = ["My name is ", "I live in ", "My favorite food is "];

// wait 3 seconds
